# DineBook Frontend

## Overview
DineBook Frontend is a small personal project I developed—a web application for restaurant table reservations. It’s built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive design, and utilizes `useContext` for global state management. The app offers user authentication, table booking, profile management, food reviews, and menu search capabilities.

> **Note**: This is the frontend part of the application and needs to be used in conjunction with the [dine-book-backend](https://github.com/supphawit/dine-book-backend) repository.

## Features
- **Login & Registration**: Secure user sign-up and sign-in.
- **Table Booking**: Simple system to reserve restaurant tables.
- **User Profile**: Manage personal information and view booking history.
- **Food Reviews**: Add and browse reviews of menu items.
- **Menu Search**: Search functionality for exploring the restaurant’s menu.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript for robust, type-safe code.
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive layout.
- **State Management**: `useContext` for efficient global state handling.
